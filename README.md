# Image-Forgery-Detection-Using-DCT
Detects areas of copy-move forgery in images using the concept of Discrete Cosine Transforms

## About
This project focuses on detecting a specific form of image forgery known as a copy-move attack, in which a portion of an image is copied and pasted elsewhere. Weâ€™ve accomplished the task of implementing a detection method for this kind of forgery, using image processing concepts such as discrete cosine transforms and quantization.

***The Algorithm***

## Steps to run 
1. Download and store all the files present in the _Code Files_ locally
2. Mention the name of the image you'd like to read at _line 19_ in the **_cmf_detect.py_** file
3. Run _cmf_detect.py_ to see results.
